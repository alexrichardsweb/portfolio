  <p>A web developer from Wales.</p>


  <p>This site was built using Vue and Nuxt, with content powered by NetlifyCMS. Some of the components &nbsp;use a version of Jordan Scales' 98.css which I have altered to look more like Windows 95 -https://jdan.github.io/98.css/</p>


  <p>The icons, backgrounds and cursors were ripped directly from Windows 95&nbsp;</p>
